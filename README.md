# OpenCode Revamp 💻

</br>

> ***Website design*** is an extremely crucial aspect as it determines the very first impression we make on our audience. It impacts how our audience perceives us and this impression can either get them to remain on our page or leave it. 

</br>

Through this repository, you will be able to revamp and redesign certain sections of the OpenCode website and use your design skills and instincts to transform these sections and improve the User Interface.

## Common Guidelines:

- The Repository is divided into several tasks. Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only. NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific folders.
- The submissions will be judged by the mentors and points will be allotted by them for each particular task based on various aspects and intricacies of design like design thinking process, originality of the idea, visual appeal of the submission, etc. 
- Since everyone should be awarded for their efforts, the participants who qualify the **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)**,  which will be mentioned in the respective folders of the task once the submission duration begins, will be awarded **Full Points🎉**.

> ALL THE FINAL DECISIONS FOR THE JUDGEMENT AND AWARDING OF POINTS ⚖️ BASED ON THE SUBMISSION RESIDE WITH THE MENTORS & ORGANISERS. 
> No claim can be made on the number of points awarded by the Mentors & Organisers🙂.
